A 1.sup.st M-VAWT and 2.sup.nd M-VAWT of Twin M-VAWT, comprising clocked mirror image of one another in close proximity to one another, as recited in claim 1, each of which comprising further an airfoils assembly of multiple pairs of planet and sun airfoils that are flexible in shapes and sizes, and these paired planet and sun airfoils cooperate and interact between each other, wherein: a) one planet airfoil is mounted to one rotating planet rotor through cap and base plates, the rotating planet rotor is mounted to top and bottom carrier plates, and the one planet airfoil is in a fixed rotational orientation relative to and in rotation around a stationary sun rotor shaft;  and one sun airfoil, mounted to the top and bottom carrier plates, and paired to one planet airfoil, is in radial alignment to and in rotation around the stationary sun rotor shaft;  b) the planet airfoil, translational images of one another in rotations around their stationary sun rotor shaft, is a curved segment shaped similar to a circular curved segment for a high lift and drag hybrid airfoil, where: curved segment is centered symmetrically about and rotates around its planet rotating shaft;  its rounded leading edge pointed along X axis away from M-VAWTs   mirror image plane;  its curved segment chord is aligned to X axis, and has a chord width just short of 2.times.  the distance between planet rotating shaft and sun stationary shaft;  its curved segment radius is about the same as the segment chord width, with a center point on a line parallel to Y axis through and below its planet rotating shaft;  and its curved segment is the upper +Y smaller segment;  and c) the sun airfoil, rotational images of one another in rotations around its sun rotor stationary shaft, is a curved segment shaped similar to a circular curved segment for a high drag airfoil, where: its curved segment is just slightly less than a quarter of a circle, or less than half of a semicircle, centered on or near its planet rotating shaft;  its curved segment is part of the half of a semicircle closer to the sun stationary shaft;  its curved segment radius is about the distance between a planet rotating shaft and the sun stationary shaft, and is slightly longer than half the chord width of a planet airfoil for positive rotational clearances between them;  one of its curved segment end is at the semicircle mid-point, and its other curved segment end is at an angle less than 90 degrees away toward the sun stationary shaft; rotations of a sun airfoil is in accordance to rotations of its semicircle chord aligned to a line connecting the planet rotating shaft to the sun stationary shaft;  when a sun airfoil with its semicircle chord is rotated horizontal inline to X axis, its semicircle chord is also inline to its paired planet airfoil curved segment chord, and the sun airfoil projected width on the X axis is approximately half the planet airfoil cord width;  d) the paired planet and sun airfoils are mounted indirectly or directly to the carrier plates, and have the same rotational rate around the sun rotor stationary shaft;  a sun airfoil makes one rotation around its paired planet airfoil without interference in every one rotation around the sun rotor stationary shaft;  and the paired planet and sun airfoils are sized to be freely rotating;  e) in one rotation around the sun rotor stationary shaft, paired planet and sun airfoils move through a reciprocal half a rotation power and return cycles, where: the half a rotation power and return cycles are where planet airfoils face toward and away from applied wind;  in rotations, the planet airfoils with paired sun airfoils that have rotated away are always facing against applied generally straight flowing wind;  the sun airfoils with paired planet airfoils having rotated away are rotated by generally straight flowing applied wind from any direction;  and in combination, the paired planet and sun airfoils alternate as wind shields in rotations, particularly in return cycles.'"
